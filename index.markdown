## We'll be back shortly

Like a fool I kept a bunch of wordpress sites running alongside my main domain stuff at thephilwells.com and, lo and behold, it all got infected with malware. Bluehost pulled the plug on my account and I had to scrap pretty much everything in there. I'm taking this as an opportunity to migrate all my web stuff over to Jekyll on Github pages.
