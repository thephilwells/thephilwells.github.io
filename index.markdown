## The Phil Wells Dot Com!

Welcome to my landing page. This is me, Phil Wells.

You can email me any time at <philwells5000@gmail.com>

If you're here to check out my books (which are "fun" and non-technical), I love you. Follow these links:

* [Dudesong](https://bookshop.org/books/dudesong/9780615701745)
* [Try the Veal](https://bookshop.org/books/try-the-veal/9780595407767)

If you want to read my poetry, you can find the archive of my defunct poetry newsletter here:

* [Little Epic archive](https://philwells.substack.com/)

If you're here to determine whether I'm a legitimate software engineer in the world, maybe you could:

* Play [Word Pants](https://thephilwells-wordpants.glitch.me/), a game I built over the course of a few days
* Look at [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/thephilwells), though of course most of my GitHub use is for work stuff which is hidden from the public
* Look at [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thephilwells/)
* [Download my resume as a PDF](https://github.com/thephilwells/thephilwells.github.io/raw/master/download/resume.pdf)

If you're here for anything else, I don't know what to tell you. I wish I knew. 

That's the page for now. Nice and simple, I think. Wouldn't want to overdo it.

Thanks for reading. This is Phil.
