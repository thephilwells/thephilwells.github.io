You walk through a big white trellis at the north end of a big green lawn. Ivy has crawled over the top of the trellis and, finding more ivy crawling up from the other side, crawled over that ivy to get back down again. A garden path, gray and almost pink brick pavers, yawns out ahead of you. Coneflowers and milkweed lurk behind rows of begonias and marigolds and other various annuals. Someone's been busy, and not just all these bees, buzzing so loud they're rattling.

The path goes north a bit before branching off east and west. East of here you can hear, improbably, the bleeps and bloops of an arcade. Over west you the garden darkens a bit. Where do you want to go from here?
